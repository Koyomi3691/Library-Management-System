# Library-Management-System
There are two modules in this project, 1. User 2. Librarian.
The user can issue a book with a time period.
The librarian can add and remove the book.
To issue the book, the user can write the name of the book and the prompt will come.
If no book is available, a prompt will come.
The librarian can see how many books have been issued and how many are still in shelf.
